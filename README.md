# approximation-of-matrix-norms
Matlab code repository for numerical experiments from the paper "Tight computationally efficient approximation of matrix norms with applications" by A. Juditsky, G. Kotsalis and A. Nemirovski:

1. "Boeing" peak-to-peak optimized control experiment from Section 3.3.3 of the paper

    Code in /boeing folder; use boeing_demo.m to start the simulation

2. System identification experiment from Section 4.3.2

    Code in /ident folder; use id_demo.m to start the simulation
